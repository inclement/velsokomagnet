History of the Velsokomagnet
============================

A little [sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban)-type puzzle game made using
[PuzzleScript](https://www.puzzlescript.net/).

The player repels crates even from a distance, but then also sticks to them if they get
too close. Both effects can be a great annoyance if not used correctly.

This was an experiment to see if I could make an interesting puzzle game. Let me know if
you somehow find this and feel inspired to have an opinion.
